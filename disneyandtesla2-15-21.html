        <p class="articlebody">Last August Tesla Motors announced a 5-1 stock split, decreasing the stock’s price from almost two thousand dollars to less than five hundred. The split came as a major victory for Elon Musk, 
        Tesla’s CEO, in the face of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/31/investing/tesla-stock-split-trnd/index.html"><u>numerous short sellers</u></a> who had been betting on the stock to decrease in value. Tesla’s value has only increased since the split; as of this article’s writing, Tesla’s value currently stands at $817 per share. 
        Tesla’s immense financial success as of late, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, is notable. Apple has also recently engaged in a stock split, splitting 4-1; Apple’s value has also continued to rise after the move. 
        With companies such as Tesla and Apple engaging in very lucrative stock splits, it may be beneficial to examine which company will be next on the list. </p>
    	<p class="articlebody">Another company that may warrant attention for a potential split is the Walt Disney Company; albeit the company’s present situation may not indicate it. Currently, their stock trades at a considerably lower 
    	value compared to Tesla and Apple, even after the splits. Disney’s stock lost significant value at the onset of the pandemic, falling to approximately $85 per shareon March 20th. The company temporarily ceased operations at its parks worldwide, 
    	and much of their announced digital content was postponed. The subsequent loss in revenue caused the company <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/11/26/disney-layoffs-coronavirus-disneyland-still-closed/6432147002/"><u>
    	to layoff over thirty thousand employees</u></a>. </p>   
       <p class="articlebody">With the release of new digital content on its streaming platform Disney+, however, the company has experienced a significant rebound in value. Currently, the company’s stock trades $186 per share, an approximate 
       one hundred dollar increase from their lowest point during the pandemic. Additionally, there exist indications that Disney’s value could continue this upward trend. Disney’s rebound has occurred while 
       <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-posts-smaller-expected-drop-210727344.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALMMt8Uq5YSRylVcJOXAc334vufRB3NEGIIyjTVKVl45qXSY0TufkpZE992aJ1hnqDkG_br1qPLEPxuALnyvFdc06zKMO5hQCRPNCxOwxpbA5jK51r1V9MgtAEqbzYYJm5rV-xQbC9xHmHZ2ixRL__SwW8oWyNN3dwxTo62hRTBQ">
       <u>park attendance continues to suffer</u></a>. Intuitively speaking, it is reasonable to assume that Disney’s theme park attendance will grow significantly as more individuals become fully vaccinated and the threat of the pandemic begins to dissipate. This increase in revenue from parks 
       could precipitate a massive rise in Disney’s stock price.</p>
       <p class="articlebody">While The Walt Disney Company may not currently be poised for a stock split, it remains important to seek out potential candidates before the value of their stock begins to soar. Investor confidence in the company has 
       increased significantly in recent months and Disney’s stock value has increased three percent over the past month, and eleven percent over the last quarter. Currently, the title of this article may sound foolish to some investors; but do not 
       be surprised to see a potential split on par with Tesla and Apple in the coming years. After all, there was a point when their stock value made a split look like a pipe dream as well.</p>
