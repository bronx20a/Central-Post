        <p class="articlebody">To say that the 2020 election cycle was a tense period would be one of the most significant understatements that I could write. To say that the period of political tension following the election results 
        is behind us would also be a significant understatement. Ever since the first week of November, there has been a lot of political “noise.” Accusations have been hurled, lawsuits have been filed, and, something I never thought that 
        I would have to write about in the United States, violent actions have been carried out. A lot of pundits and so-called internet personalities have been arguing about what is “real” and what is not and what is “factual” and what is not. 
        It is very easy to get lost in all of the noise, especially if you do not study politics. It is perhaps even easier to get a headache from all of it. So, let’s try to quiet the noise, take a step back, and carefully analyze the 2020 election.</p>
 		<p class="articlebody">An indisputable fact of the 2020 election is that people showed up for it, and I mean really showed up for it. Voter turnout for this past election was larger than any election in recent memory. By recent memory, I mean in 
 		the last <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers"><u>120 years</u></a>. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/turnout-soared-in-2020-as-nearly-two-thirds-of-eligible-u-s-voters-cast-ballots-for-president/"><u>Sixty-two percent</u></a> of eligible voters cast their ballot in the election, up from approximately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/turnout-soared-in-2020-as-nearly-two-thirds-of-eligible-u-s-voters-cast-ballots-for-president/"><u>fifty-five percent</u></a> in 2016 (a total increase of over eight million votes). President Biden garnered <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers"><u>eighty-one million</u></a> votes 
 		to former President Trump’s nearly <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers"><u>seventy-five million</u></a>. Biden’s tally is the most ever for a presidential candidate and the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers"><u>first to pass eighty million votes</u></a>; Trump’s tally is the second most for a candidate, and the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers"><u>largest tally for an 
 		incumbent president</u></a>. Whether this massive increase in turnout was due to the economic and social damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or in response to the social justice movement that took the country by storm over the Summer, remains a matter of  
 		debate. Nevertheless, it is indisputable that more people than ever in modern history were able and motivated to participate politically, and that is always a good thing for a democracy.</p> 
 		<p class="articlebody">The next question is, why did citizens vote in the manner that they did? In other words, beyond the candidate’s names, what was on the ballot that caused them to vote one way or the other? To answer this question, we have to start 
 		by analyzing each candidate. I am not talking about their policy platform; rather, I am speaking to the philosophy behind their entire candidacies. Let’s start with President Biden. In the primary, Biden campaigned on being a “centrist.” For the purposes of 
 		2020 Democratic Presidential Primary, being a “centrist” just meant that the candidate did not align himself or herself with the policy positions of Senator Sanders or Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. In the general election against then-President Trump, Biden campaigned on much more 
 		“left” agenda. He spoke energetically on an aggressive strategy to curb COVID-19 infections, restore environmental regulations and treaties, and restructure US foreign policy. Essentially, Biden campaigned as the antithesis to President Trump; he positioned himself 
 		as the candidate to return to the policies of the Obama administration.</p> 
 		<p class="articlebody">When looking deeper into the philosophical underpinnings of Biden’s message, it unsurprisingly echoes the same sentiment as former President Obama’s 2008 campaign. The main sentiment behind Biden’s campaign is hope. More specifically, it is about 
 		hope for a reformed America, one in which changes can occur that lead the country down a much different path than the one it is on currently. This sentiment can be observed in Biden’s campaign advertisements, speeches, and interviews. From healthcare to racial justice to 
 		environmental sustainability, the sentiment is always the same: hope for change. If this sentiment sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Biden’s campaign sentiment is almost indistinguishable from President Obama’s campaign philosophy, manifested in Obama’s “yes we can” campaign slogan. 
 		Obviously, such sentiment was very successful for Biden, as it was for Obama over a decade ago.</p>
 		<p class="articlebody">Former President Trump campaigned on a much different sentiment. While his 2016 campaign was based on change, his 2020 campaign was about fear. More specifically, it was about fear for what lies ahead if Biden’s political agenda becomes a reality. This sentiment can 
 		be found in all of former President Trump’s campaign media. He consistently emphasized the negative consequences of what he termed “Biden’s America.” His campaign sentiment was clear, Americans should be afraid of what the other side is proposing, and they should vote for Republicans so that a 
 		Democratic outcome is avoided. His messaging was very powerful; after all, former President Trump accrued seventy-five million votes after a presidential term marred by an impeachment trial, civil unrest, and a nationwide pandemic that, at the time of the election, had killed hundreds of thousands of US citizens.</p>
 		<p class="articlebody">After a long, muddled campaign season that pitted two diametrically opposed political philosophies against one another, hope won. Despite the court battles and demonstrations, it is clear that a plurality of Americans preferred hope for what’s to come over fear for what lies ahead in their political 
 		discourse. However, there are still seventy-five million Americans that are afraid of what’s to come; their voices should not be discounted. To build a better United States and a brighter future for all of the country’s citizens, all individuals need to unify behind a simple common ground. Both Trump supporters and Biden supporters 
 		want to make this country better, even if they have completely different methods for achieving such improvement. When the United States presents a unified front, its accomplishments are unmatched. If it were to happen again, there is no limit to what the country could achieve.</p>
