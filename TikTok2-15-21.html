        <p class="source">Source: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/tiktok-wechat-ban-exposes-a-slew-of-us-tech-stocks-to-chinese-retaliation-risk.html">CNBC</a></p>
        <p class="articlebody">Last fall, the Trump administration enacted bans on the social media applications WeChat and TikTok, both of which are developed by a Chinese parent company. The Trump administration 
        argued that these applications could have privacy breaches and personal data could be acquired by the Chinese government. These bans were short-lived, however, as a judge delayed WeChat’s ban and TikTok’s 
        ban was put on hold due to an impending deal with Microsoft. In the end, the Trump administration was never able to enact either ban before leaving office. There still exists a great of uncertainty, however, 
        surrounding social media applications with Chinese parent companies. Privacy and data breaches could allow government entities to acquire sensitive information from United States consumers. The group most affected 
        by this economic and political dilemma is the newest generation of Americans, known as Gen Z. </p>
        <p class="articlebody">Gen Z has taken to TikTok en masse.  An entire generation of individuals born between 1997 and 2012 has propelled the social media application from relative obscurity to one of the most popular 
        platforms in the world. The newest generation is drawn to the short video lengths and endless feeds of content. TikTok users, sometimes aged fourteen or younger, with no social capital can become internet stars using music 
        and dance routines. A majority of the app’s most frequent users may be embroiled in a political and economic situation that they may not be old enough to fully comprehend.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Growing beyond just another popular social media platform, TikTok has become its own economy, where users can experience their own version of the idealized American dream. Any user can create content and, 
        with no follower-specific feeds, videos are dispersed across the entire TikTok general populace. This massive distribution allows completely unknown users to reach millions of people with a funny video or catchy music number.  
        When users reach ten-thousand followers, they can access TikTok’s “creator fund” and accrue earnings from their videos. Many popular users become so-called “influencers,” similar to Instagram, and earn endorsement products. 
        These are some of Generation Z’s first experiences with the market economy. The sudden collapse of TikTok’s economy could spell disaster similar to that which continues to be seen in the previous generation. </p>
        <p class="articlebody">Millennials were devastated by the height of the recession in 2009. The sudden lack of economic opportunity and rising costs of housing occurred right as millennials were preparing to enter the workforce. 
        The coincidental timing was devastating as the generation struggled to find work and many were <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/deloitte-shifts/making-it-millennial/259/"><u>unemployed for years following the recession</u></a>. 
        The effects of this disaster are still felt today, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/beyond-bls/millennials-after-the-great-recession.htm"> <u>as millennials have some of the lowest home ownership rates compared to the same point in previous generations</u></a>. 
        As a result, millennials have a significant amount of distrust in the government, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/"><u>a majority have markedly different views on the government and economic system, 
        with many calling for significant reform</u></a>. If the United States is not careful, the same disaster could occur with Gen Z. </p>
        <p class="articlebody">To suddenly deplatform TikTok would have far-reaching implications for teenagers and young adults across the country. Their first experience with the economic system would be one in which the government took away an 
        opportunity to rise to stardom and utilize an economy that a growing number of Americans don’t believe is working for them. The seeds of doubt and distrust that were sowed into the millennial generation will grow in Generation Z. The two generations 
        that are entrusted with leading the country to future prosperity will not believe in the country that they’re representing. Gen Z may not understand the political implications of such a decision, but they will certainly remember, and respond to the 
        impacts that it will cause. With the Trump administration gone, the Biden administration must be sensitive to the implications that political decisions could have on Gen Z or they will doom this generation to the fate of the previous one. </p>
