        <p class="source">Source: <a href="https://heatnation.com/media/miami-heat-coach-breaks-down-tyler-herro-channeled-his-swagger-throughout-rookie-season/">Heat Nation</a></p>
        <p class="articlebody">Last season, the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals from Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The two stars of that series 
        were LeBron James, a household name for even those who have never watched sports, and Tyler Herro, a twenty-one-year-old rising star in the world of basketball. The series would 
        culminate with a 106-93 Lakers’ win in Game 6, winning the series by a count of four games to two. While James may have won his fourth NBA championship title in a decisive fashion, 
        there is no doubt that his reign of complete dominance over the National Basketball Association will soon be coming to an end. </p>
       <p class="articlebody">LeBron James averaged nearly <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html"><u>twenty-seven</u></a> points per game in the 2020 playoffs and is averaging <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html"><u>twenty-five</u></a> points per game through the first twenty-eight games 
       of this season; at first glance, this may seem like a cause for concern for someone making the argument that James’ days as the dominant force in the NBA are limited. However, James recently 
       turned thirty-six years old and is entering a period where some of the NBA’s most prolific stars have experienced significant declines. For example, Michael Jordan averaged nearly <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html"><u>thirty</u></a> points
       per game when he was thirty-three and thirty-four years old; he declined significantly thereafter, averaging <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html"><u>twenty-two</u></a> and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html"><u>twenty</u></a> points per game coming out of retirement during ages thirty-eight 
       and thirty-nine, respectively. Of course, there are a number of differences between the two players that any one of which could make the case that Jordan’s timeline will not apply James. In any event, 
       James will undergo decline, as all athletes eventually experience, and there is evidence to support the argument that it may happen sooner rather than later.</p> 
       <p class="articlebody">Tyler Herro, on the other hand, is just getting started in the NBA. He’s currently in his second season, where he is averaging <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/herroty01.html"><u>seventeen</u></a> points per game. Herro averaged <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/herroty01.html"><u>sixteen</u></a>
       points per game during the last playoffs, in his first season, at just twenty years old. In the NBA Finals against James’ Lakers, Herro averaged <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/herroty01.html"><u>fourteen</u></a> points per game. These stats may seem eclipsed 
       by James’ superior numbers, but it is important to consider the data relative to age. For equivalency purposes, in Michael Jordan’s seasons during ages twenty-one and twenty-two he averaged <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html"><u>twenty-eight</u></a> and 
       <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html"><u>twenty-three</u></a> points per game, respectively. Then, Michael Jordan erupted statistically, averaging over <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html"><u>thirty</u></a> points per game every season until he took a brief hiatus to play professional baseball. 
       Herro’s numbers are nowhere close to Jordan’s, but certainly it would not be out of the question to see a significant rise in Herro’s averages over the next few seasons. What’s apparent, some may say obvious, 
       is that James will soon experience a significant decline whereas Herro could see a significant rise, which leads to the less obvious point of this article. James’ extremely talented Lakers team versus Herro’s 
       talented but inexperienced Heat team symbolizes more than just a David versus Goliath showdown. Rather, this showdown symbolizes a passing of the torch, from the old guard of NBA stars to the new one.</p>
       <p class="articlebody">LeBron James has dominated the NBA for the better half of this century. His rise to dominance occurred alongside, and against, NBA legends such as Dwayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, and Paul Pierce. 
       All of those players have now been retired for at least two seasons. Bryant and Pierce played for <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html"><u>nineteen</u></a> and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/piercpa01.html"><u>eighteen</u></a> seasons, respectively. James is entering his <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html"><u>seventeenth</u></a> season. It is no secret that the era 
       of early 2000s basketball stars is fading quickly. LeBron James has been able to postpone fate, but he cannot put it off indefinitely. On the other hand, NBA players such as Tyler Herro, Trae Young, and Luka Doncic 
       continue their rise to prominence. With this changeover comes a new approach to basketball; new styles, strategies, and even personalities have begun to change the game as we know it.</p> 
       <p class="articlebody">With the Lakers’ decisive win, and their continued dominance into the beginning of this season, it is clear that the changeover from old guard to new is not yet complete. LeBron James may even 
       continue to defy expectations and dominate statistically into his forties and postpone the changeover for another several years. However long it takes, the changeover will eventually be complete, and the game of basketball 
       will look entirely different from the way it did ten years ago (if it does not already). The question is not a matter of if it will happen, but when.</p>
