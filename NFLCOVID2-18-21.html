        <p class="articlebody">Early into the 2020 NFL Regular Season, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Tyrod Taylor was the subject of a significant medical blunder. As a team doctor was 
        attempting to administer a painkiller to remedy Taylor’s cracked ribs, he accidentally punctured the quarterback’s lung. This mishap led to a medical emergency in which Taylor was 
        rushed to the hospital. He turned out to be fine and made a full recovery. His career prospects, however, were mortally wounded; first-year quarterback Justin Herbert took control of the 
        position in Taylor’s absence and never relinquished it. Taylor’s unfortunate career outcome, resulting from a clearly avoidable medical emergency, raises an important question during a time 
        when many professional athletes are trying to balance their careers with pandemic concerns. What responsibility, if any, do medical staff on professional sports teams have to the athletes? </p>
        <p class="articlebody">The first part in unpacking this complex question is to answer whether doctors have a responsibility to ensure player safety. Of course, medical professionals cannot 
        prevent on-field injuries, they can only remedy them after they have occurred. But do doctors have an obligation to attempt to heal the player of his or her injuries, or is the obligation merely 
        to triage the athlete so that they are able to return to play? In either case, the doctor in Tyrod Taylor’s incident clearly failed to uphold the obligations of the medical profession. Still, in 
        the midst of an international pandemic, it is important to discern exactly where medical professional’s obligations lie.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Since last summer, professional sports organizations have been strategizing how to best resume operations while prioritizing public health concerns. Each organization has implemented 
        a slightly different strategy, and there have been varying levels of success between each of the sports. The so-called “bubbles” that the National Hockey League and National Basketball Association used to complete 
        their 2020 seasons seemed to be a resounding success from a public health standpoint. However, the return to play for the regular season for the NHL, NBA, and NFL has been far more difficult. Each organization has 
        experienced spikes in cases and been forced to postpone and reschedule games; additionally, the restrictions on fan attendance has led to considerable <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/pro-sports-teams-lost-major-230024921.html"><u>losses in revenue</u></a>.</p>
       	<p class="articlebody">As professional athletes navigate how to protect themselves from the virus while participating in leagues’ return to play plans, what role do doctors play in keeping these players safe? More importantly, 
       	do doctors have a responsibility to ensure that athletes recover fully from their ailments, or are doctors obligated to prioritize making the player cleared to play as soon as the designated waiting period has passed? Alternatively, 
       	should team-specific doctors avoid involvement in COVID-19 cases entirely, and let third-party doctors handle such situations? In cases such as the one reported by <a href="https://brownswire.usatoday.com/2020/12/20/browns-de-myles-garrett-still-battling-effects-of-covid-19/"><u>Myles Garrett</u></a>, players have struggled with the lingering aftereffects 
       	of COVID-19. Yet, players continue to return to play after the designated waiting period of two weeks, regardless of their medical condition at that time. It is clear that the view of professional sports organizations is that doctors are to get 
       	infected athletes cleared and returned to play as soon as possible. Whether doctors ought to take on more responsibility, after the incidents with Garrett and Taylor, in ensuring player well-being beyond merely the ability to play certainly merits 
       	more debate than what is currently being had now in professional sports.</p>
