   	 <p class="aboutme">My name is Tony, I recently graduated, in the spring of the pandemic, 
      with a degree in Business and Politics. After spending the past several months witnessing the divisive
      rhetoric and anger-fueled events, I decided to create a place for those looking to stay up to date
      on the newest events while escaping all of the partisan noise. The Central Post is meant to be a platform
      for nuanced, balanced, and thoughtful analysis that comes from years of researching and learning about the effects of 
      various political and economic events on our society. If you have any questions about the platform or thoughts on how improve the 
      organization, please reach out to me using the <a href="./Contact Us.html">"<u>Contact Us</u>" </a>page.</p>
