        <p class="articlebody">Everyone witnessed the uproar in the stock market that occurred in late January. For anyone who may not, here is a significantly abbreviated 
        summary. A Reddit group named r/wallstreetbets learned of many investors who were shorting (in clearer terms, to “short” a stock means to bet against it) stocks in GameStop, AMC, and 
        several others. After learning of multiple hedge funds with significant exposure to these shorts, the group mobilized to drive up the price of the stock. These price increases caused 
        hedge funds to take billions of dollars in losses to cover their shorts. The resulting volatility caused many retail trading applications, such as Robinhood, to limit trading on such stocks. 
        In the end, stock prices normalized and the “to the moon” movement faded into the background. This tumultuous situation raises an important question: is this event a one-off situation, or is what 
        happened on Wall Street a part of a larger movement of which GameStop is just the beginning?</p>
        <p class="articlebody">There is no definitive answer to this question, yet. There is, however, significant evidence that r/wallstreetbets is just getting started. GameStop was not their only target, 
        the group also achieved stock increases, albeit to a lesser extent, in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/bed-bath-beyond-amc-rally-wjoin-gamestop-in-rally-as-trend-of-retail-investors-squeezing-hedge-funds-spreads.html"><u>AMC Entertainment, Blackberry, and Bed Bath and Beyond</u></a>. The page is still very active on Reddit, despite being <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/reddits-wallstreetbets-is-back-taking-on-gamestop-stock-after-intentional-lockdown/"><u>temporarily 
        suspended</u></a> for seemingly unclear reasons, and has been plotting their next move. The group has been <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/85-dogecoin-rally-shows-wall-street-bets-aren-t-done-with-doge-yet"><u>focusing much of its recent efforts on Dogecoin</u></a>.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that originally began as a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-rises-over-400percent-after-reddit-group-talks-it-up.html"><u>joke</u></a>; the <a href="https://dogecoin.com/"><u>Dogecoin website</u></a> states that “Dogecoin is an open-source, peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide.” 
		The same users that have taken credit for recent volatility in the stock market are now taking credit for Dogecoin’s sudden rise. A Dogecoin is currently valued at $0.057, which has increased six-fold in the past 
		month. While the GameStop frenzy was meant to shatter the status quo of Wall Street hedge fund investing, the motives behind Dogecoin appear to be different. Investors appear to be investing in Dogecoin just to see its 
		value increase. Such mass mobilization of retail traders through platforms such as Reddit could alter the financial landscape permanently.</p>        
        <p class="articlebody">Indeed, beyond Reddit, the trend of retail trading is <a href="https://qz.com/1970462/gamestop-and-reddit-inspired-a-global-wave-of-new-traders/"><u>growing rapidly</u></a>. Investing has become more accessible than ever before, and individual traders can connect with each other at any time. These new 
        developments may open the door to an entirely new financial landscape. This time, it was r/wallstreetbets, next time it could be an internet personality on twitter who decides that Bed, Bath, and Beyond is a great company and that 
        people should buy their stock. Said personality can now connect with millions of users worldwide, who use retail trading applications such as Robinhood, to achieve a significant price increase in Bed Bath and Beyond. The days of merely 
        reviewing financial data when making investment decisions may be in the past. Investors may now be forced to review an organization’s social media presence to see if the stock could be boycotted or popularized in the near future.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">The new wave of technology has revolutionized every aspect of socioeconomic society, and it appears the financial system is no exception. With retail trading occupying a growing percentage of the market, activist trading 
        groups such as r/wallstreetbets will only grow and proliferate. Increased democratization in financial services will help to expose market inefficiencies such as the overexposure to short positions. Retail trading applications may soon outpace 
        traditional trading interfaces, and new, even more accessible interfaces may yet be developed. Whatever the implications of this mass market movement, it is clear that the financial services industry has been forever changed, perhaps for the better.</p>
