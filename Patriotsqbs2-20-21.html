        <p class="articlebody">The New England Patriots are widely regarded as being one of the most successful sports franchises of this century. Undoubtedly, the Patriots’ six Super Bowl 
        championships are a testament to their incredible success. It appears the days of the Patriots dynasty may be fading, however, as the team finished the most recent season with a subpar 
        seven wins and nine losses. While New England’s poor performance could be explained by the pre-season opt-outs of star linebacker Dont’a Hightower and starting safety Patrick Chung, much of the blame 
        has been placed on who played under center. After Tom Brady’s exit from New England and his immediate success in Tampa Bay, there are many questioning whether the Patriots success was due to anything other 
        than their legendary starting quarterback. Now, there are many uncertainties regarding who will be the starting quarterback next season. With so many unanswered questions, it is important to clear the air by focusing on what can be deduced right now. </p>
        <p class="articlebody">Cam Newton, the Patriots starting quarterback for almost all of last season, had a few impressive games. Newton achieved a quarterback rating of over <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewtCa00.htm"><u>one hundred</u></a> in four games; in those games he threw for a combined total of over <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewtCa00.htm"><u>eight hundred yards, five touchdowns, and zero interceptions</u></a>. 
        However, there were just as many games where he struggled. Newton had a quarterback rating of below <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewtCa00.htm"><u>sixty</u></a> in four games this season; in those games he had a combined total of just under <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewtCa00.htm"><u>five hundred yards, zero touchdowns, and seven interceptions</u></a>. In the other seven games that he played in (Newton did not play in the Patriots’ 
        game against the Chiefs) Newton appeared serviceable, mustering a quarterback rating between <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewtCa00.htm"><u>sixty and one hundred</u></a>. On balance, Cam Newton did not have a successful enough season to guarantee the starting quarterback position for himself in New England (or for any other team, for that matter), but he did not underperform enough to immediately be taken out of 
        contention for the job either. As a result, Cam Newton remains a viable option for the Patriots moving forward, should head coach Bill Belichick be looking to pursue such a possibility.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">The other quarterback currently on the Patriots roster that merits review is Jarrett Stidham (for previous performance and age concerns, Brian Hoyer is not being considered in this article). Stidham, a recently drafted quarterback from Auburn University, looked unimpressive in the most recent NFL season. 
		In the five games that he played in (he did not start in any of the five games), Stidham completed <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StidJa00.htm"><u>fifty percent</u></a> of his passes for just over <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StidJa00.htm"><u>two hundred-fifty yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions</u></a>. Stidham finished the season with a quarterback rating of <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StidJa00.htm"><u>sixteen</u></a>. If the previous season is any indication, the 
		Patriots future prospects at quarterback look uneasy at best given their current options.</p>       
       	<p class="articlebody">While these metrics may paint a grim portrait of the New England quarterback room, certain mitigating circumstances must be considered. Prior to the 2020 season, Cam Newton had recently experienced a <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/cam-newton-injury-timeline-return-date-updates/btaqvlw0wi5a1gsgyo3lu01ue#:~:text=On%20Nov.,safely%20return%20to%20the%20field."><u>foot injury which caused him to miss almost all of the 2019 season</u></a>. Jarrett Stidham was entering only his second 
       	season after spending his first year behind starting quarterback Tom Brady, which obviously meant very few snaps for the young quarterback. Both quarterbacks entered this season with no preseason, and little time to become acquainted with the Patriots organization. Coupled with the loss of key defensive players, and there exists significant evidence 
       	that the lack of Patriots success in 2020 did not have anything to do with a lack of skill amongst the quarterbacks. This reasoning could be why Belichick has not closed the door on either <a href="https://www.sportscasting.com/cam-newton-might-not-be-done-in-new-england-after-all/"><u>quarterbacks’ returning under center for next season</u></a>.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">While there is an argument to be made for the current Patriots quarterbacks, there are credible, realistic options in the trade market, free agency, and the draft that New England could pursue. With Carson Wentz, Jarred Goff, and Matt Stafford having been traded, however, the free agent quarterback market is narrowing rapidly. 
		Bonified starting quarterbacks such as Deshaun Watson and Russell Wilson carry much too high a price tag for Belichick, who often looks for hidden value in obscure, sometimes even unknown players. The 49ers appear <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/jimmy-garoppolo-trade-rumors-where-49ers-stand-moving-franchise-qb"><u>unwilling to trade Jimmy Garoppolo</u></a> which would have been the most realistic trading option for the Patriots. The other various quarterback prospects 
		such as Ryan Fitzpatrick, Jameis Winston, and Marcus Mariota may not be on the Patriots radar given their mid-tier skillset and lack of knowledge with the Patriots system.</p>        
       	<p class="articlebody">The draft may be the most promising option for New England. <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Alabama-football-Mac-Jones-Mel-Kiper-projects-New-England-Patriots-to-draft-Crimson-Tide-QB-NFL-159974384/"><u>Many analysts</u></a> pen Alabama quarterback Mac Jones at the top of the Patriots’ prospect list. Indeed, drafting a quarterback and using Cam Newton to serve as the quarterback in the interim while the prospect develops could be a viable solution. The question remains, however, as to 
       	whether Belichick has given up on Stidham. If Belichick still has faith that the former third round pick can develop into a serviceable starter, then it would more sensible for New England to use their early draft picks to fill out some of the lacking skill positions on the roster.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Surprisingly, perhaps the most viable quarterback situation for the Patriots is their current one. Cam Newton now has a full season of experience with the Patriots’ system, and he will, presumably, have a full season this year to develop with the team. Jarrett Stidham will be entering his third season and should see significant 
		improvement with increased repetitions and preseason training camp. Perhaps Belichick has once again outsmarted all of the analysts calling for New England to make a blockbuster trade or signing. After all, it would not be the first time that Belichick sees talent in a place where no one else does.</p>
