        <p class="source">Source: <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/buffalo-bills/2021/02/nfl-free-agency-rumors-jj-watt-wants-these-4-things-from-next-team-how-do-bills-stack-up.html">syracuse.com</a></p>
        <p class="articlebody">In <a href="./theking2-14-21"><u>another article</u></a>, I discuss the crucial role that former New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist could play for a Stanley Cup contending organization. In the case of former 
        Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt, the situation is much the same. In fact, where J.J. Watt chooses as his next destination could alter the landscape of the division or conference that he enters. Arguably, 
        until Myles Garrett entrance into the league, J.J. Watt was the most dominant defensive end in football. Watt is the only player in National Football League history to record <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2014/12/28/texans-j-j-watt-on-verge-of-nfl-history/"><u>two twenty or more sack seasons</u></a>, 
        and he holds the Houston Texan’s records for the most sacks and forced fumbles.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Of course, J.J. Watt is not the same athlete that he as a half-decade ago. His metrics have fallen considerably since his second through fifth seasons, where he averaged <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WattJ.00.htm"><u>over ten sacks in all four years</u></a>. 
        His fifth and sixth seasons following this stellar performance were spent mostly on the inactive list, as Watt struggled with injuries and only played <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WattJ.00.htm"><u>three and five</u></a> games, respectively. He returned to form during the 
        2018 season where he recorded <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WattJ.00.htm"><u>sixteen sacks</u></a>. However, he would only play half the season in the following year; and last season he registered <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WattJ.00.htm"><u>five sacks</u></a>, despite starting all sixteen games. Watt will be thirty-two 
        years old at the start of the next season, and understandably franchises may be wondering where Watt’s value lies.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">J.J. Watt may no longer be the defensive end that terrorized professional quarterbacks, but his value should not be diminished. On a team that is contending for the Super Bowl, Watt could provide a much-needed boost or 
        even be the final piece needed to propel a team from championship hopeful to champion. Why Watt still has such value goes beyond sacks. It goes beyond saying that J.J. Watt is a leader. He exemplified leadership qualities with the Texans, 
        and he will bring the same veteran leadership to his next destination. Additionally, his impassioned drive to win a Super Bowl will help to change the culture of the organization and can energize younger players to step into new roles.</p> 
       	<p class="articlebody">Indeed, J.J. Watt still possesses considerable value despite his age and statistical decline. The crucial question that Watt must answer is which prospective franchise gives him the best opportunity for that potential to be 
       	realized. A team such as the Cleveland Browns comes to mind as a fitting suitor. The Browns have a talented, young roster that showed that they can compete with some of the NFL’s most premier talent last season. A veteran player such as Watt would 
       	complement opposite defensive end Myles Garrett and provide a veteran presence for younger players. Other potential suitors include the Buffalo Bills and the Green Bay Packers. The Bills are a Super Bowl contender and have a young core roster in need 
       	of a leader, and Watt could fill that role very effectively. The Packers have an aging roster, but Watt may be the final piece needed to propel NFL MVP quarterback Aaron Rogers to the Super Bowl, which has illuded him for a decade.</p> 
       	<p class="articlebody">Where J.J. Watt decides to contribute could turn a team from a conference championship contender to a likely winner, a contender for the division leader to a statistical probability, or even a Super Bowl hopeful to the top team in the NFL. 
       	Wherever J.J. Watt signs, he will have one goal: to win a Super Bowl. After almost ten seasons, Watt wishes to end his career as a champion. For that reason, he must carefully choose his next destination; many teams will bid for the veteran but only a handful have the necessary assets 
       	to accomplish J.J. Watt’s ultimate, and perhaps only, goal.</p>
