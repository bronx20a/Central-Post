        <p class="source">Source: <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/28/sports/henrik-lundqvist-says-hes-scheduled-open-heart-surgery/">Boston Globe</a></p>
        <p class="articlebody">Henrik Lundqvist, a future first ballot hall of fame athlete, may not be playing this season but he is determined to make a return to hockey and further solidify his legacy. 
        The Washington Capitals, the winners of the Lundqvist sweepstakes last fall, signed the veteran goaltender to a one-year contract. Despite Lundqvist’s early setback, it’d be amiss for the Capitals 
        to give up on a potentially crucial asset. Henrik Lundqvist has been immensely successful in his career thus far; he finished his tenure with the Rangers as the team leader in games played, wins, save 
        percentage, and shutouts. Despite these accolades, Lundqvist has fallen short when it comes to, arguably, the most important category: Stanley Cup Finals wins. Lundqvist gave everything to the 
        Rangers, and now he just wants what every hockey player dreams of: to lift The Cup. </p>
        <p class="articlebody">The King, Lundqvist’s nickname that he earned from years of dominance in the NHL, has seen his role diminished in light of his advanced age. Despite his age, Lundqvist 
        has performed serviceably, recording a 2.52 goals against average and a .905 save percentage on a rebuilding Rangers franchise last season. Now, Lundqvist is determined to make one last attempt 
        to win a championship. And, if his performance from 2020 is any indication, he may be able to meaningfully contribute on a team that is contending for the Stanley Cup.</p>
       <p class="articlebody">The Capitals fit this mold perfectly. While the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018, they haven’t made another appearance during Alexander Ovechkin’s, also a future first 
       ballot hall of fame athlete, career. The Capitals’ core roster is aging; Alexander Ovechkin, John Carlson, and Nicklas Backstrom, all important members of the 2018 championship team, are thirty-three years old or older. 
       It is clear that the Capitals’ window to win another Stanley Cup championship is restricted to the next two or three seasons, after which the Capitals will most likely rebuild their roster and effectively douse any chances 
       of Ovechkin winning another championship. The Capitals are in what’s known as “win-now” mode, so too is Henrik Lundqvist.</p>
       <p class="articlebody">The Capitals have all the pieces needed to put together a roster worthy of the Stanley Cup. Star offensive players such as Alex Ovechkin, Evgeny Kuznetsov, and T.J. Oshie are significant upgrades from 
       the less experienced offensive talent on the Rangers. Young goaltenders Vitek Vanecek and Ilya Samsonov take some of the pressure off of Lundqvist, allowing him to potentially start in twenty games as opposed to forty, which 
       may be too taxing for a goaltender of his age. Henrik Lundqvist is more determined than ever to hoist the Stanley Cup over his head before he rides off into the sunset, and he is joined by an experienced, talented Capitals team 
       that is desperate to win another championship before they enter a rebuilding period. These realities combine to create a potentially perfect storm of success, and the Capitals would be unwise to let such a storm pass unnoticed.</p>
       <p class="articlebody">If the Capitals let this opportunity go unnoticed, however, there are other options where The King would be a near perfect fit. Teams such as the Boston Bruins, Las Vegas Golden Knights, and Pittsburgh Penguins 
       have similar situations as the Capitals. With talented rosters and an aging core group of players, each of these teams is aiming to win a championship before they must enter a rebuilding phase. Lundqvist could play a major role in bringing 
       the first Stanley Cup to Las Vegas, putting another notch in Sydney Crosby’s career, or giving Tuukka Rask the backup help that he needs to bring The Cup back to Boston. Wherever Henrik Lundqvist ends up next season, one thing is certain: 
       The King can still compete, and it would be a mistake for any franchise to let his potential be overlooked.</p>
