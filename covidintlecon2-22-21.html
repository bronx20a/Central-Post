        <p class="articlebody">The international pandemic has <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/emerging-market-economies-coronavirus-pandemic.html"><u>stifled investments into emerging economies</u></a>, and for good reason. Pandemic related restrictions have been notoriously more strict in countries that are not named the United States. The restrictions have greatly affected economic growth internationally and temporarily halted such investments. 
        As the effects of the pandemic begin to fade, however, emerging markets will surely be a product of significant interest for investors. The question is, will the post-pandemic emerging market environment be the same as the pre-pandemic one? There is evidence to suggest that an identical emerging market environment may not be the case. </p>
       	<p class="articlebody">For those who are interested in this topic, emerging markets are countries who exhibit lower than average per capita income and rapid economic growth. These two metrics, when combined, have the potential to create significant volatility, which is why such investments have exceptionally high risk/return ratios. 
       	According to <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/c0db0a48-01f2-4ba9-ad01-226fd5678111"><u>The Morgan Stanley Capital Emerging Market Index</u></a>, the countries classified as emerged markets are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, 
       	and United Arab Emirates. This list was compiled, however, before the world economy felt the full impact of the pandemic. As I discuss in <a href="./COVID&consumers2-17-21.html"><u>another article</u></a>, consumer trends may have permanently shifted as a result of COVID-19, emerging markets may have shifted as well.</p>
       	<p class="articlebody">For instance, purchases into the travel and entertainment industries should increase precipitously as a result of “pandemic fatigue.” Airlines, travel agencies, and cruise lines should experience significant revenue growth nearing the end of 2021, when the pandemic’s effects are expected to <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/12/anthony-fauci-offers-a-timeline-for-ending-covid-19-pandemic/"><u>diminish significantly as a result 
       	of worldwide vaccination campaigns</u></a>. Nations that are reliant on tourism should see significant increases in investment as travel picks up, perhaps for a relatively long period of time. Caribbean island nations come to mind as potential candidates for future emerging markets.</p>
       	<p class="articlebody">As a case in point, consider the Caribbean nation of Jamaica. Jamaica currently has a gross national income per capita of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false"><u>$5,320</u></a>, which is less than the world average of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false"><u>$11,571</u></a>. The country is significantly tourism dependent, with tourism making up <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/jamaica/#economy"><u>a fifth of Jamaica’s entire gross domestic product</u></a>. 
       	Jamaica has experienced a steady GDP growth rate of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?most_recent_value_desc=false"><u>0.7%</u></a> which is well below the growth rates of emerging markets, whose economic growth rates typically range between <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-emerging-markets-3305927"><u>four and seven percent</u></a>. Research for all of these metrics were conducted in 2019, before the onset of the pandemic. With many consumers eager to travel again, increased investment 
       	into the travel industry could propel Jamaica to achieve record economic growth rates. Of course, other factors could hinder this possibility, such as Jamaica’s issues with <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/country/jamaica"><u>government integrity and financial freedom</u></a>. This case is just to illustrate a geographic region, which has been excluded from the emerging market conversation, that has the potential to become 
       	a source of emerging markets in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
       	<p class="articlebody">Conversely, certain emerging markets may fall out of such status when the pandemic passes. Manufacturing, an industry that is typically found in an emerging market, may experience a significant decline. Consumers may exhibit decreased demand for manufactured goods, especially since the demand for services, which has been considerably restricted 
       	for the last eleven months, should increase significantly. Consumers may be more interested in purchasing “experiences” such as travel excursions, dine in restaurants, and bars and other entertainment venues rather than products such as apparel or home goods, to which consumers have experienced virtually unrestricted access during the pandemic. Manufacturing hubs, which 
       	comprise the backbone of emerging markets, such as Indonesia, India, and Thailand may experience decreased levels of economic growth, perhaps even enough to lose emerging market status.</p>
       	<p class="articlebody">All of the reasoning presented in this article is pure conjecture. The possibility of the emergence of Caribbean island tourist economies and the fall of central Asian manufacturing hubs may be as fantastical in reality as it sounds in theory. Many financial analysts and researchers would certainly disagree with the reasoning presented here. However, 
       	it would not be the first time that said analysts had overlooked key trends in their assessments (see <a href="./gamestopamc2-21-21.html"><u>GameStop</u></a>). In truth, nobody knows the effect of the pandemic on emerging market trends with absolute precision. The possibilities presented, however, merit consideration. The pandemic has changed every other aspect of socioeconomic society, it would be foolish to assume 
       	that emerging markets will be spared.</p>
