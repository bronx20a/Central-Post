        <p class="articlebody">All current indications make the title of this article seem fantastical. The Boston Bruins just won the President’s Trophy last season for 
        the best regular season record. The team is only two years removed from a Stanley Cup Finals appearance. And the team appears to be firing on all cylinders at the start of the current 
        season with ten wins, three losses, and two losses in overtime through fifteen games. Indeed, the Bruins have enjoyed exceptional play from star forward David Pastrnak and Charlie McAvoy 
        has developed into a top tier defenseman. At first glance, the Bruins seemed poise to begin the 2020s with a Stanley Cup dynasty. Looking more closely, however, reveals evidence that the Bruins’ 
        decline may be closer than it may appear.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Tuukka Rask, the starting goaltender for the Boston Bruins since 2012, has performed anywhere from serviceably to incredibly during his tenure. That tenure, however, may 
        soon be coming to an end. On more than one occasion, Rask has seemed to hint in interviews at <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/report-bruins-tuukka-rask-says-retiring-next-season-possibility/"><u>stepping away from professional hockey</u></a>. This possibility became a serious consideration after 
        Rask’s sudden departure from the 2020 NHL playoff bubble for, completely understandable, family reasons. Rask has enjoyed a very successful career that has included three Stanley Cup Finals appearances and 
        one championship in 2011 while backing up then starting goaltender Tim Thomas. It would be sensible for Rask to retire to spend more time with his family. Who will take over Rask’s role on the team remains 
        a serious question that the Bruin’s management must begin considering if they wish to remain a Stanley Cup contender.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Currently, there does not appear to be an heir apparent to Tuukka Rask. Jaroslav Halak has been a more than capable backup over the past couple of seasons, posting a <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/h/halakja01.html"><u>2.3 goals against average 
        and a .921 save percentage</u></a>. Halak, however, will be <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/h/halakja01.html"><u>thirty-six years old</u></a> at the start of next season. While Halak is more than serviceable when starting between thirty and forty games in a season, a goaltender 
        of his age may not be able to handle a fifty to sixty game slate. If his time with the Islanders[citation] is any indication, using Halak as the sole starting goaltender could have disastrous consequences for Boston.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">The only prospect that has proven to be a potential starting goaltender is Daniel Vladar. The twenty-three-year-old third round draft selection has only played in one game for Boston which came in relief 
        during a disastrous playoff blowout to the Tampa Bay Lightning. In the AHL, however, Vladar has looked promising; during the last season, Vladar posted a <a href="https://theahl.com/stats/player/6503"><u>1.79 goals against average</u></a> and a <a href="https://theahl.com/stats/player/6503"><u>.936 save percentage</u></a> in twenty-five games. 
        Unfortunately, Vladar will only be <a href="https://theahl.com/stats/player/6503"><u>twenty-four</u></a> at the start of next season, and the general practice is to allow goaltending prospects to develop until approximately twenty-six. Starting Vladar too early could completely derail his development 
        and potentially ruin a promising goaltender. Thus, if Rask were to retire before the beginning of next season and the Bruins did not accomplish a significant trade or signing, there would be no viable option to continue Boston’s success in between the pipes.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Apart from goaltending, the Bruins core roster is also beginning to age significantly. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-washington-capitals-boston-bruins-nhl-zdeno-chara-11760a277afa45cc1100611d7b918336"><u>release of Zdeno Chara</u></a> has already cost Boston a key asset for veteran leadership. The new captain, Patrice Bergeron, is <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/b/bergepa01.html"><u>thirty-five years old</u></a>. 
        While Bergeron has played exceptionally thus far in his career, it will not be long before he experiences a significant decline, potentially in the next one or two seasons. David Krejci, a crucial part of Boston’s success over the past decade, will soon be <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/k/krejcda01.html"><u>thirty-five 
        years old</u></a>. Krejci may also experience a significant decline in the near future. Brad Marchand, once a young prospect for Boston, will soon be <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/marchbr03.html"><u>thirty-three</u></a>. If Boston were to begin next season with no major transactions, they could be a team with no viable 
        starting goaltender, a diminished Bergeron and Krejci, and a Marchand in the final few seasons of his best play.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Reviewing this evidence, it is clear that Boston must make significant transactions to win the Stanley Cup during this season or the next. Major transactions could include bringing on another veteran star player looking to win a Stanley Cup before retirement, 
        such as Sydney Crosby or Patrick Kane (these are not meant to be realistic possibilities, just food for thought). If Tuukka Rask retires at the end of this season, the Bruins could also sign or trade for a veteran goaltender, such as Sergei Bobrovsky (again, food for thought), and make another attempt with the veteran core.</p>
        <p class="articlebody">Alternatively, the Bruins still have promising young talent in players such as David Pastrnak, Charlie McAvoy, and Anders Bjork; bringing on young, promising prospects may allow the Bruins to skip a rebuilding period and continue their period of Stanley Cup contention. In any event, 
        the Bruins championship window with their current roster is closing quickly. If Boston’s management does not become cognizant of this reality soon, the Bruins may be facing a long rebuilding period.</p>
